# YouTube Downloader GUI

## Description

YouTube downloader Save is a Website tool that allows users to download videos from YouTube onto their devices. These downloaders typically work by copying the video's URL and pasting it into the downloader interface, which then retrieves the video file and saves it locally on the user's device. This enables users to watch the videos offline, without needing an internet connection, and often allows them to save videos for future reference or sharing with others.

it is cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and can be used in any terminal.
